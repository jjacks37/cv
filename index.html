        <p>Hi! My name is Jasmine Jackson. I was raised in Riverdale, Georgia.
          I am currently a student at Savannah College of Art and Design and I’m getting
          my B.F.A. in Illustration. I can’t remember the time when I was first introduced
          to art, but I do know I’ve always liked drawing and coloring. I think it was
          when I was in the 8th grade when I decided to seriously try to train myself to
          get better at drawing. I would take the sketchbook my parents had bought me for
          Christmas and sit for hours in front of the computer looking at images and
          trying to replicate them. The first art teacher I had that taught me about the
          foundations of art was my 10th grade art teacher, Mr. Norwood.
          <br>
          My art work now is based on portraits of people. I’m trying to capture their
          likeness but also tell the viewer a bit about their personality through my use
          of color and other little details. I start my and finish my work in photoshop.
          I use textured brushes so that the pieces don’t look too digital. I like the
          rough look of traditional so sometimes I scan in a sketch that I’ve done and
          start to paint on top of that.
